# @carnesen/cli [![npm version badge](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40carnesen%2Fcli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40carnesen%2Fcli) [![build status badge](https://github.com/carnesen/tsconfig/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carnesen/tsconfig/actions?query=workflow%3Atest+branch%3Amaster)

A framework for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Node.js. This package includes runtime JavaScript files suitable for Node.js >=10 as well as the corresponding TypeScript type declarations.

## Usage

```
npm install @carnesen/cli
```

A `@carnesen/cli` CLI organizes commands into a tree. Each leaf is an action (e.g. "list"). Branches (optional) can be used for navigation (e.g. "cloud users list"). Here is a simple CLI whose root command is a leaf:
```ts
// readme.ts
import {
  CliLeaf,
  CliFlagArgParser,
  CliNumberArrayArgParser,
  runCliAndExit,
} from '@carnesen/cli';

export const root = CliLeaf({
  name: 'multiply',
  description: 'Multiply numbers and print the result',
  positionalArgParser: CliNumberArrayArgParser({ required: true }),
  namedArgParsers: {
    squared: CliFlagArgParser({
      description: 'Square the multiplication product too',
    }),
  },
  action(args, { squared }) {
    const multiplied = args.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1);
    if (squared) {
      return multiplied * multiplied;
    }
    return multiplied;
  },
});

if (require.main === module) {
  runCliAndExit(root);
}
```

Here's how that behaves as a CLI.
```
$ ts-node readme.ts
Usage: multiply <num0> [...] [<options>]

   Multiply numbers and print the result

Options:

   [--squared] : Square the result before printing it

Error: "<num0> [...]": Value is required
```

With arguments:
```
$ ts-node readme.ts 1 2 3
6
$ ts-node readme.ts 1 2 3 --squared
36 
```

## Structure of argParsers
A `@carnesen/cli` CLI specifies 
```
<program> <branch> <leaf> <positional-args> --name <named-args> -- <escaped-args>
```

TODO: Make a diagram.

To invoke an action the user provides (in order):
- zero or more branch names
- a leaf name
- zero or more positional args
- zero or more "options" (argParsers of the form `--foo bar`)

### ArgParser<T, U>
TODO

### CliLeaf({name, description?, args?, options?, action, hidden?, version?})
A factory for creating "action" commands. Returns the newly-created `leaf`.

#### name
If this "leaf" is a subcommand, `name` is the string that the user will pass as the "subcommand" argument to invoke this action. If this "leaf" is the root command, `name` should be the CLI's name.

#### description
(Optional) A string that will be included in `Usage:` if present.

#### positionalArgParser
(Optional) An `ArgParser` for 

#### namedArgParsers
(Optional) An object of named `ArgParser`s, for example:
```ts
const options = {
  path: createStringArgParser({
    description: 'An absolute or relative path',
  }),
}
```
The `args` and `options` properties define how the command-line arguments get parsed and transformed before being passed into the `action` function.

#### action(args, options)
The function that defines your command logic. `action` can return a value synchronously like in the "multiply" example above, or it can be an `async` function that returns a `Promise`. If `action` returns/resolves a value, that value is `console.log`ged before the CLI exits. If `action` throws/rejects, the exception is `console.log`ged before the CLI exits. That means that if you don't want the user to see a stack trace, your `action` should throw a `string` instead of an `Error` object. The type of the `args` argument received by `action` is derived by the `args` property of the leaf. Similarly, the `options` argument type is derived from `leaf.options`.

#### hidden
(Optional) `boolean`

#### version
(Optional) `string`. If provided, this string will be printed when the user does `cli --version` or `cli -v`. If this value is not provided, `@carnesen/cli` will attempt to find a version string in your package.json file.

### CliBranch({name, description, subcommands, hidden?})
A factory function similar to `CliLeaf`. Returns the newly-created `Branch` object.

#### name
If this "branch" is not the root command, `name` is the string that the user will pass as the "subcommand" argument to invoke actions in this part of the command tree. If this "branch" command is the root command, `name` should be the CLI's name.

#### description
(Optional) A string that will be included in `Usage:` if present.

#### subcommands
An array of `Branch` and/or `Leaf` objects.

#### hidden
(Optional) `boolean`

### createCli(root)
Returns a function of the form `(...args: string[]) => Promise<any>` that can be invoked as e.g. `cli('foo', 'bar')` for unit tests or as `cli(process.argv.slice(2))` in an executable CLI script.

#### root
A `Leaf` or `Branch`

### ArgvInterface
`cli` is a function that takes command-line arguments (strings) as argParser and returns a `Promise` representing the execution of the arguments. We export `cli` so that we can unit test it [like so](src/examples/__tests__/readme.test.ts).
